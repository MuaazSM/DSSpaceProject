🚀 SpaceX Falcon 9 Data Science Project

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launches to uncover the key factors influencing successful landings and reducing launch costs by improving rocket reusability.

🎯 Objectives
	•	Extract SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data using APIs and web scraping.
	•	Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize launch trends.
	•	Query the launch data using SQL for insights.
	•	Build a Machine Learning model to predict launch success rates.
	•	Deploy an interactive dashboard using Dash to visualize insights.
